# RPS-Multiplayer
A multiplayer online Rock Paper Scissors game utilizing JQuery and Firebase.

#Description
This application allows two users with separate sessions to play Rock Paper Scissors against one another. As expected, paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beats paper. Two users' win/loss rates and chat messages are tracked and updated using Firebase. 

#Getting Started
This can only be played in pairs, so open up two separate tabs on one or two machines.
